Business organization number NO 918470573

## Introduction

This policy describes what information we collect when you use
Whereby’s websites, services, mobile applications, products, and
content (“Services”). It also provides information about how we store,
transfer, use, and delete that information, and what choices you have
with respect to the information.

This policy applies to Whereby’s online video meeting tool,
including the website and mobile applications, and other Whereby
websites (collectively “the Websites”), as well as other interaction
(e.g. customer support conversations, user surveys and interviews
etc.) you may have with Whereby.

This policy applies where we are acting as a Data Controller with
respect to the personal data of users of our Services; in other words,
where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that
personal data. For content and data that you upload to or make
available through the Service (“User Content”), you are responsible
for ensuring this content is in accordance with our Terms of Service,
and that the content is not violating other users’ privacy.

## How we collect, process and store information

Whereby is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our
users. Our business model is to provide a paid service to users who
need additional features on top of the Free version, and does not rely
on widespread collection of general user data. When you use our Services,
we will only collect and process information that we need to deliver the
Services to you, and to continue to maintain and develop the Services.

Whereby may collect, store and process various kinds of data, with
different legal grounds, as listed below. For the categories of data
that require your consent, we will obtain your consent before
collecting any data. You can give and revoke your consents at any time
in your [Settings page](https://whereby.com/user/privacy).

The following is a list of data we collect, process or store, with the
purpose and legal ground listed for each item or group of items having
the same purpose and legal ground:

* **User account information.** Users that choose to register for
  Whereby will have to provide a valid email address or phone
  number. The user can also choose to enter a display name and/or add
  a profile picture that will be used to represent them in
  conversations. If you as a user choose to sign up with an external
  authentication service, e.g. Google Sign-In, we will fetch and store
  email address, name and profile image URL from this service. 

* **Room information.** To create a room in Whereby, you as a user
  will have to select a room name. This name will be publicly visible
  and will be used by other users accessing meetings in that room. You

  and the content has to be compliant with our guidelines for
  Prohibited Content in Terms of Services.

    other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We
    may, for example, use a business address submitted by your

## How we process media (audio/video)

We will never store any media sent between participants in a
room. Customers who have access to the “Recording” feature will be
able to record meetings, and they are then responsible for collecting
consents from all participants in the meeting prior to starting the
recording. They are also responsible for storing and processing the
recording in compliance with regulations after downloading it from
Whereby.

### Security
In the Free version of the Services, users can use “Small meeting” mode
(up to 4 participants). In “Small meeting” mode, communication between
participants are primarily sent through peer-to-peer connections,
where audio and video streams are sent directly between participants
and do not pass through any of our servers. Video and audio
transmitted in the Services is then sent directly between the
participants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with
client-generated encryption keys. In cases where a user is behind a
strict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN
server, but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.

If you have upgraded a room to PRO, you can choose to use “Large
meeting” mode (up to 12 participants). Calls using “Large meeting”
mode will use a dedicated server infrastructure to allow more people
in conversation, and better stability. Your stream will be sent
through video router servers which transmits it to the other
participants in the call, and also transmits their streams to
you. Streams will always be encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) in transit, but will
be decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video
routers. We operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed
across the world, and you will be automatically routed to the closest
one. The video router servers and all of our infrastructure adhere to
strict security measures, preventing any eavesdropping or interruption
of the video/audio streams.

## Providing your personal data to others

We may share your personal data with third parties in some
circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service
provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with
academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization;
(4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as
pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; or to (5) to protect the
vital interest of others, when we have reason to believe that doing so
will prevent harm to someone or illegal activities.

Our categories of service providers and partners are:
* Hosting/infrastructure/storage providers
* Payment processors
* Analysis tools providers
* Customer support tools providers
* Marketing and email providers
* Recruiting tools providers
* Internal communication tools providers

### Business Transfers
We may disclose your personal data to any member of our group of
companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company
and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the
purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy.

In the case where we are involved in a merger, acquisition,
bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your
information would be transferred or become subject to a different
privacy policy, we will notify you in advance and give you the option to delete your data before the transfer.

## International transfers of your personal data

In some circumstances your personal data may be transferred to
countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). You acknowledge
that personal data that you submit for publication through our Websites
or Services may be available, via the internet, around the world. We

others. For information about what types of content you as a user is
responsible, see this

facilities for usage information are situated in Ireland and the
United States. Transfers to the United States will be protected by
appropriate safeguards, namely the use of standard data protection
clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission, a copy of
which can be obtained from the [European Commission website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

## Retaining and deleting personal data

Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be
kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

We will retain your personal data as follows:
* Transaction information will be retained for a minimum period of 5
  years following date of the transaction, and for a maximum period of
  10 years following the date of the transaction.

In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the
periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases,
we will determine the period of retention based on the following
criteria:
1. Account information, room information will be retained until you
   decide to delete your account or delete a room in Whereby.
2. Information about you used for product & marketing communication
   will be retained until you withdraw your consent or opt-out, depending
   on if the processing is based on consent or our legitimate interest. You
   can change permissions through [Privacy
settings](https://whereby.com/user/privacy).
3. The period of retention of usage information will be determined
   based on the need for historical data to determine statistical
   validity and relevance for product decisions and technical
   monitoring.

Regardless of the provisions above, we may retain your personal data
where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal
obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital
interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
